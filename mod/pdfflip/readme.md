# PDF Flipbook Moodle Activity

This Moodle activity module allows teachers to upload a PDF and present it to learners using a simple flipbook interface. The viewer relies on the open source **pdf.js** library to render PDF pages inside the browser and a lightweight script to navigate between pages.

## Installation

Copy the `pdfflip` directory into your Moodle `mod` directory and visit the *Site administration > Notifications* page to complete installation.

## Usage

When adding a new *PDF Flipbook* activity, upload your PDF file and configure the usual activity settings. Learners will be able to flip through the pages using the navigation buttons.

This is a very small demonstration plugin and does not aim to provide a fully featured flipbook experience.
